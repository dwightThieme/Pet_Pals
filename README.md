## Pet_Pals
A Simple Heroku app demonstration

### Deploying an application

* In this activity, we will deploy a Pet Pals application to Heroku. The applications takes the name, latitude, and longitude of a pet and plot its location on a map. The actual code for the application is not nearly as important as the steps for deploying to Heroku. These steps can repeated for your own applications.

* This process consists of:

    1. Creating a repo for the application
    2. Preparing the application with additional configuration files (`Procfile` and `requirements.txt`)
    3. Creating the Heroku application
    4. Preparing the Heroku database
